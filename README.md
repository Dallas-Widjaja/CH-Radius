# Radius Automation Test Suite (Proof of Concept)
 
## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an automation test suite with basic test scripts designed as a proof of concept for the Radius software.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how automation can reduce the time and effort required to validate Radius functionality before building a full regression suite.
 
Manual regression testing of Radius currently takes over 2 weeks for a single individual to complete.  
This proof of concept lays the groundwork for a future comprehensive regression test suite that will cover all core features of Radius and drastically shorten testing cycles.
